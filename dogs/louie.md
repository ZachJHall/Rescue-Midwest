  Hi! My name is Louie. I am a six (6) year old, male, brown Merle Chihuahua. I
  have medium-long hair, giant ears, and beautiful, light-colored eyes. I look
  like a little teddy bear.


  I love going on long walks and I tend to bark at everything. (I am a very good
  watch dog.)


  I come from a very loving home and never have been abused. I love to be held
  and shown lots of attention.


  I am neutered, have my teeth cleaned annually and am up-to-date on my shots. I
  am a very healthy and happy little guy. I weigh around 8-10 lbs.


  I am trained to use a potty pad, but prefer to go outside even when it is
  cold, but not when it is raining. I am terrified of storms.


  My human parents divorced 2 years ago, so my mom had to go back to work and
  she is gone all day. I don’t like being home alone. It makes me very anxious
  and stressed! I have started having frequent accidents in the house.


  Mom and I think that I would be much happier if I had a stay-at-home human
  again.


  I am looking for someone who is patient, kind, loving and
  understanding—especially if I have an accident.


  I prefer a human who has prior experience with Chihuahuas and likes to take
  daily walks!!! I am not a fan of small children or big dogs. I am looking for
  a calm, loving environment to call home. Please call or text Cass Swanson at
  (314) 930-9305 if interested.
