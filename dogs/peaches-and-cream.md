description: >-
  12 year old Peaches and Cream are a bonded pair (brother and sister) that are
  very sweet and need to be adopted together.  Their mom is in the hospital long
  term and will no longer be able to care for them and she is very worried about
  finding them a good home.  The female needs daily eye drops and is partially
  blind. They are both trained to go on pee pads as well as outside.  They are
  good with cats and other dogs.  They have been well taken care of their whole
  lives and are up to date on vaccinations and fixed. They just need a warm bed
  to snuggle on and someone to love them.  They are located in St. Peters,MO and
  will only be adopted out in the St. Louis region.  Please fill out an
  application if you are interested in being a forever home for these sweet
  dogs. Please email Vicki at vwagner1@icloud.com if you have any questions.
