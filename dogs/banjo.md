  Banjo and Anna are 2 years old and are brother and sister.  They are both
  major cuddle bugs and would love nothing more than to be on a lap.  Anna is
  the more timid one and her brother is always making sure she is okay.   She is
  afraid at first but very sweet and comes out of her shell given a little
  time.   Banjo is a little more independent and curious.   He likes to play and
  investigate.   They can both be rambunctious when playing together but usually
  only in short spurts.   They cuddle up together when they can’t be on a lap
  and keep each other company. They are very bonded.   They are good with other
  small dogs and cats, they were afraid of our big dog at first and growled but
  never bit.  After a couple of days they’ve realized she wont hurt them and are
  trying to play with her.   They are housebroken.  They will follow you around
  and be your shadow and want to sleep in bed with their humans.  Very sweet
  dogs and will make awesome companions.  They are more inclined to females but
  quickly warmed up to my husband and teenaged son. They don’t like it when
  either wears a hat. They were both fine with my 8 year old nephew, but not
  sure they would do well in a house with very young
