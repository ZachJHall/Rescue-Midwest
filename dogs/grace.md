  Grace is a sweet terrier/chihuahua/dachshund mix.  She loves everyone and is
  housebroken.  She will follow you around all day long and snuggle you in bed. 
  She does have dry eye and needs prescription drops in the morning and evening
  and artificial tears mid day.  She is so easygoing when putting her in her
  drops. She keeps her eyes open for you and everything! She has trouble seeing
  because her former owner did not treat her eyes as needed, but gets around
  just fine.  Grace will have her dental in the next couple of weeks (mid to
  late April) and is updated on her vaccinations.  She is located in the St.
  Peters area and will only be adopted out in the surrounding area.
