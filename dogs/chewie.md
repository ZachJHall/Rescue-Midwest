description: >-
  Chewie is the sweetest little girl you can imagine.All she wants to do is lick
  your face and curl up beside you.She is somewhat energetic, especially when
  someone gets back home.Chewie wants to make you happy, and is unfortunately
  terrified of being reprimanded so itâ€™s best to be gentle with her.This little
  lady has both looks and brains, as she has a knack for figuring out doors and
  doggie doors easily.She can jump higher than you would expect, and is ready to
  hop up beside you on any couch, chair, or bed.  She is not good with cats.
  Chewie is located in Columbia, MO.  We do not ship dogs or adopt long distance
  due to volunteers needing to come out to do a home visit.
