description: >-
  Oliver is a happy-go-lucky little pup who is young at heart. Even though he is
  8 years old, he acts like a dog half his age. He really loves going on walks
  and would love to accompany you on your daily hike or morning jog. He is potty
  trained and will alert you any time he needs to go outside. While he’s not
  aggressive, one of his favorite past times is chasing cats, therefore, he’d
  probably do better in a cat free household. When he’s not chasing the cat or
  running outside, he prefers to be laying by your side quietly. He enjoys lots
  of cuddles and will be your perpetual shadow. Oliver also has a cute little
  quirk of having a lazy eye, so often he’ll be looking at you and also keeping
  an eye on the cat. Please no small children if considering adopting this
  little love bug.
