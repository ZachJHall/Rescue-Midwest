  Ralphie the cuddlebug just wants to curl up beside you no matter where you
  are! Heâ€™s a sweet and loving older chihuahua who has lost most of the hair on
  his head, almost making him look like baby Yoda. But with some TLC, he is
  slowly growing his hair back. He loves walks and sunning himself in the yard.
  He is potty trained and has no behavioral issues, and just wants your love and
  attention. He does well with other dogs and with cats.
