  We have a situation where an elderly parent can no longer stay in her home and
  she has a chihuahua “Auggie” who needs a home. We are looking for help placing
  Auggie in a good home. One son can’t keep him due to allergies and my family
  can’t keep him. We live on a working farm and Auggie is not safe given our
  working dogs and predators. He can’t stay in our home because he does not like
  cats and we can’t displace our two house cats. Auggie is 7-8 years old,
  up-to-date on all shots and is neutered. He is a house dog, potty trained and
  would do best as a home with only dogs. Auggie’s owner will move to a nursing
  home in a few weeks and Auggie will be maintained in her home until he can be
  placed. Auggie is currently in a rural area where dog fighting is a concern
  and bait dogs are in demand.
