description: >-
  Beanie, renamed Queenie, was rescued in Chicago after giving birth to a litter
  at her ripe old age.  She is super sweet and resting for a bit and should be
  ready for adoption the 3rd week of July.  I will post more details about her
  when I have them but so far she is such a sweetheart!  She will only be
  adopted out to the St. Louis area.
