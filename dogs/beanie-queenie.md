description: >-
  Beanie (now called Queenie) is a sweet, snuggly little girl. She is 10yrs old,
  an owner surrender due to almost dying in labor. Has had 3 litters, is UTD and
  has been spayed. Recently recovered from weaning puppies and seems to be a
  happy and healthy girl. She prefers to sit on your lap or beside you, but will
  snuggle independently in her bed. Likes to snuggle under the covers in bed at
  night and has the cutest snore. She enjoys the company of other dogs, but
  isn't overly friendly and gives them space if needed. She is potty trained and
  goes outside, but will use a piddle pad. I have been told she is good with
  children, but have no experience with her around children or cats. She is
  generally calm, but will bark at people she does not know and the doorbell.
  She knows how to sit when asked, but is very timid with other commands and
  will cower and roll over if she is unsure of what is being asked. Will do well
  in a quieter home with a calm dog or two to give her confidence.  Queenie will
  only be adopted out to the St. Louis and surrounding areas.
