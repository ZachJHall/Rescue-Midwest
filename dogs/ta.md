  TA is an energetic three-year old-chihuahua who loves to play! Heâ€™s spent most
  of his life in a kennel but is now breaking out of his shell. He loves to play
  fetch, or at least chase the ball. He is very friendly and sociable, and wants
  you to be as active as he is. He is very affectionate and loves to cuddle. His
  goal in life is to make you just as happy as he is! He does well with dogs,
  cats, and kids. TA will only be adopted out to the St. Louis and surrounding
  areas.
