  This is Connor he just came into rescue yesterday. He is a lap dog. Follows
  you everywhere. Sleeps with you. He does know how to howl. He is a cutie and
  would so best in a home where someone is home all day. He is about 7 years
  old. If interested in adopting go to www.chihuahuarescuemidwest.org and fill
  out an application.
