  ADOPTED!!! Oreo is an older girl, but oh so sweet and loving. She recently had
  a dental so she is missing some teeth but that won't stop her. Oreo was found
  by a good Samaritan just wandering down Hwy 55. Once we were able to catch her
  give her a bath and get her mouth fixed she feels better and came out of her
  shell. She now enjoys taking a walk. However, her favorite thing to do is
  sleep with her person, If you want someone to sit on your lap all day and soak
  up your attention Oreo will be the perfect dog for you. She only weighs 5 lbs.
