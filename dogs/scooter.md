description: >-
  Scooter is a 15 year old Corgi/Chihuahua mix. He loves to be with his people
  and will follow you around the house. He loves to cuddle and gets a long well
  with cats, dogs, and birds. He does not like to be picked up and will
  growl/bite sometimes when you try. The vet believes it is because it hurts
  him. To get him on the bed and couch, we use ramps and steps or have him walk
  onto a pillow or small dog bed and we lift up the pillow or bed to get him
  where he needs to go. He cannot be with small children and he needs to have a
  fenced in yard. Scooter is up to date on vaccinations, microchipped, neutered,
  and just had a dental. He is located in St. Peters, MO. We do not adopt
  farther out than a 1 hour drive because we do home visits. We also do vet
  checks to make sure your pets are up to date on vaccinations and fixed. If
  interested, please put in an application on our website at
  http://www.chihuahuarescuemidwest.org. Using a laptop works best for the
  application. If you donâ€™t hear back about your app within 2 days please email
  vwagner1@yahoo.com.
