description: >-
  Chase is a spunky little guy who loves adventure. He is around 5-6 and 12lbs.
  He is a brindle mixed breed of chihuahua and miniature pinscher. Chase loves
  nothing more then a trip to the park or the lake. This little guy loves
  outdoor time and exercise. He is easygoing and travels well, yet never seems
  to tire out! He can keep up with the big dogs! Chase gets along with other
  dogs and cats. Chase would do best in a home with a fenced in yard for him to
  explore. Chase can not handle the unpredictability of children and can not be
  around them. After a long day of adventure Chase will snuggle up and love to
  cuddle. He is a very loyal guy who is smart and easily trainable. He knows
  basic commands (sit, stay, come, down, climb) and is house trained and crate
  trained. He has been through a 6 week overnight training program with Westinn
  Kennels.\

  \

  Chase has been a wonderful part of our family for years and itâ€™s heartbreaking
  for us to have to rehome such a loyal dog. However with the birth of our
  daughter we are looking for a family without children that would be more
  suitable for him.\

  \

  Chase is up to date on all vaccinations and had his teeth cleaned in 2019. He
  is located in the St. Peters area and will only be adopted out around this
  area and the surrounding St. Louis area. Please fill out an application if you
  are interested in him.
