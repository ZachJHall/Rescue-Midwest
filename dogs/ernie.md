description: >-
  Ernie is the pampered prince!He is a sweet goofball of a dog at heart, and can
  barely keep his balance when he gets his scritches.He loves to run around
  during the day, but is also perfectly comfortable on a pile of blankets or
  curled up on a couch.Ernie was originally fed scraps on a plate, which is a
  habit weâ€™re working to break, and he is a chronic cat chaser, so he should not
  be in a house where that would be a problem.  Ernie is not good with kids or
  cats. Ernie is located in Columbia, MO.  We do not ship dogs or adopt out long
  distance due to volunteers needing to complete a home visit.
