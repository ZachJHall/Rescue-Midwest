description: >-
  Barnaby is a young male who is looking for a safe forever home. He is about 10
  pounds and is about 1 yr old. This boy is very sweet and really wants to trust
  someone. He tends to be afraid of men so a single woman may be best to be his
  mom. With time, he will trust and love you enormously. We are not sure of his
  past as he was brought in by animal control. But, his foster mom says he is
  opening up more and more every day. Barnaby loves to play so if you have
  another dog who could be a sibling for him, he would love that. He does not
  discriminate and loves all dogs, big or small. We are currently making strides
  towards leash walking and potty training. Since he is young, we know he will
  master these things very quickly. We can already see he is very smart.
