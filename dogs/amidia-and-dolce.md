  Meet Dolce and Amicka, 1 year old sisters.  They are very sweet and loving
  dogs who love to cuddle. Dolce is the smaller of the two and is all black with
  white on her chest.   Amicka has gorgeous blue eyes and very unique markings.
  Good with other small dogs and cats, but are scared of their foster mom’s big
  dog.  They have a calm temperament but like to play at times.  Dolce loves
  tennis balls and especially the smaller sized ones that she can fit in her
  mouth.  Amicka is protective of her smaller sibling and always makes sure to
  know where she is.  They seem to be mostly potty trained and we are working on
  that.  They previously lived in a first floor apartment and don’t really know
  what to do with steps, so we are working on that as well.  They are crate
  trained and very sweet little girls.  This is a bonded pair that must be
  adopted together.  Dolce weighs about 8 pounds and Amicka weighs around 9.5
  pounds.
