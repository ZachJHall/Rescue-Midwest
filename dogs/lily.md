  Lily is a sweet loving dog!  She does not act like she is 9 years old at all
  which has me wondering if she is actually younger.  She is the best snuggle
  bug and always wants to be around her people.  She is good with other pets and
  loves new people.  She is playful and so silly!  Lily is located in
  Cottleville, MO (St. Louis area).  Please email vwager1@yahoo.com for more
  information or questions.
