# Chihuahua Rescue Midwest
A web app that allows the volunteer organization to update and display dogs available for adoption

# Outcome
* Decrease in yearly website costs by 96% - This is not a made up number
* Increase in number of dog adoption applications by 200% - The organization almost ran out of dogs for adoption at one point!

# Technologies used
* ReactJS
* GraphQL
* GatsbyJS
* CSS
* Netlify
* Netlify Admin Panel

# Possible plans for the future
* Partial front-end redesign - We have learned a lot since beginning this project
* Replace the dog adoption card with something custom
* Replace the footer  
The site works really well right now, so this is all contingent on the amount of free time we have to work on this.
